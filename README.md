# Endouble News
*Fetches latest news headlines from https://newsapi.org and allows to filter through them.*

In order to run the project locally you need to do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/undefeat/endouble-news.git
cd endouble-news
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you want to run the client on HTTPS, instead of ``yarn start`` run the following command:

for Windows users:
```
yarn start-https-win
```
for MacOS/Linux users:
```
yarn start-https-unix
```
